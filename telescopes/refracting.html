        <h3>About Refractor Telescopes ==></h3>
        <p>A refractor telescope is a type of telescope that uses lenses to focus light and form an image. 
            The most common design for a refractor telescope is the long, narrow telescope tube with an
            objective lens at the front end, and an eyepiece at the back end. The objective lens gathers
            and focuses light, while the eyepiece magnifies the focused image. Refractor telescopes are known
            for their sharp, high-contrast images and are often used for astronomical observation and 
            photography.
        </p>
        <p>They are also known for their durability and low maintenance, as the lenses do not
            require frequent cleaning or alignment. However, they are generally more expensive 
            than reflector telescopes of the same aperture size.
